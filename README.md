<b> Redis Server Cache Deployment with Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana on Azure </b>

- Overview -
A deployment of a Redis server cache using Kubernetes, with extensive monitoring and visualization using Prometheus and Grafana. The infrastructure is provisioned on Azure using Terraform, ensuring a scalable, maintainable, and repeatable deployment process.

- Architecture -
The project involves the following components:

Redis: An in-memory data structure store used as a cache.
Kubernetes: Orchestrates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Prometheus: Monitors the Redis server and collects metrics.
Grafana: Visualizes the metrics collected by Prometheus.
Azure: Cloud provider where the infrastructure is deployed.
Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used to provision Azure resources.
